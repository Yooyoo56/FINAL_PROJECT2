# MyCoach-Project
Second Project  Ironhack


Hello! this is the first JS & Backend project that I worked during 3 weeks!
Mycoach is the plateform where the user can easily book the meeting with coachs(Career coaches, Life coaches, Style coaches, Sport coaches).
MyCoach is the project that contains the CRUD (Create, read, update and delete) system.
- Each user can create their own account
- Each user can send the mail via Nodemalier
- Each user also can book the meeting with each coaches while filter the time, or places depends on their preferences.
