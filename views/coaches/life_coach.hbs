<p>" 3 years as a Psychologist helped to transition easily to a Life Coach career. Coaching people to improve their mindset or living conditions is meaningful. In a world where stress, time and confidence dictate your life, you need to learn how to deal with those things and sometimes make the changes to grow. My role as a Life Coach is to accompany you to realise your goal. "
